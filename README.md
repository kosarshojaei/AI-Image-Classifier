AI Image Classifier 
This project is an AI model for recognizing handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can take an image of a handwritten digit and predict what number it represents.

Features :
The model is trained using the MNIST dataset.
Capable of predicting handwritten digits from input images.
Supports various image formats like .jpg, .png, .jfif.
Built using TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training.

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
. TensorFlow
. Keras
. OpenCV
. Matplotlib
. Pillow

How to use : 
1) clone the project from GitHub  --->  git clone https://github.com/kosarshojaei/AI-Image-Classifier.git
2) run it                         --->  python image_classifier.py
3) Once the program runs, it will prompt you to select an image of a handwritten digit.
4) The model will process the image and display the predicted result.
